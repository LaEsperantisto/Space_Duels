# Space_Duels
A card game that I invented and am starting to convert it to a video game

## Note
This is currently in progress, and is in ultra - pre - alpha

## Compiling
To re-compile this, here is my reccomended command using the gcc compiler:

<pre> g++ *.cpp -lncurses -o Space_Duels </pre>
And to run it:
<pre> ./Space_Duels </pre>

- The current Space_Duels is made for Linux (Crostini), not Windows or Mac
